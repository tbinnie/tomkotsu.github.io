# Tom Binnie Portfolio Site
\
\
This site was made to showcase my Frontend experience through linked projects. It was created using React,
HTML, CSS (SASS), and JavaScript, and is dynamically animated and responsive, with an intuitive layout at all screen sizes.

It features a toggleable dark mode, which at first proved difficult to accomplish using simply useState hooks in React functional components.
This led me to experiment with and master the React Context API.

As mentioned, one of the site's main purposes is to provide links to my other projects, of which both the live link and source code are easily accessible in the Projects section.

In terms of responsivity, the navbar is replaced by a hamburger menu using media queries, and all other aspects of the site are responsive thanks to the
utilsation of flexbox and CSS grid.

The hamburger button causes an animated menu to slide in from the top of the screen, allowing for easy navigation around the site even on mobile.
